**Data files for testing**

These files are permanent, they feed the class called DataTools, in order to auto-generate test data according to the parameters set.
Files are CSV but delimiter set as ";" to be backwards compatible with Excel software.
It's important to respect the structure of the file (columns and rows), the script uses the position of the data to fill out the fields in the model folder.
